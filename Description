Given a dataset of 2D dashboard camera images, an algorithm needs to be developed to classify each driver's behaviour and determine if they are driving attentively, wearing their seatbelt, or taking a selfie with their friends in the backseat etc..? This can then be used to automatically detect drivers engaging in distracted behaviours from dashboard cameras.

Following are needed tasks for the development of the algorithm:

Download and preprocess the driver images

Build and train the model to classify the driver images

Test the model and further improve the model using different techniques.
